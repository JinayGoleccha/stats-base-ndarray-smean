Overview üöÄ
- Purpose: Compute the arithmetic mean for a 1D Float32 ndarray or a compatible typed array.
- Scope: Designed for node and browser builds where data uses single-precision floats.
- Goal: Offer a clear API, low overhead, and predictable numeric behavior for large arrays.

Why use smean
- Works with Float32Array and ndarray-like objects.
- Handles stride and offset for views into larger buffers.
- Uses a robust summation technique to reduce rounding error on large datasets.
- Small footprint and no heavy dependencies.

Installation

Node (npm)
```bash
npm install stats-base-ndarray-smean
```

Yarn
```bash
yarn add stats-base-ndarray-smean
```

CDN / Browser
- Use a bundler that resolves npm packages.
- Or include a UMD build from the releases page above. Download the build file from https://github.com/JinayGoleccha/stats-base-ndarray-smean/releases and load it in a script tag. Execute the script to register the global.

Quick Example

Basic Float32Array
```js
const smean = require('stats-base-ndarray-smean');

const x = new Float32Array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]);
console.log(smean(x)); // => 2.5
```

1D ndarray-like view with stride and offset
```js
const smean = require('stats-base-ndarray-smean');

// A buffer with interleaved values: [1,100,2,100,3,100]
const buffer = new Float32Array([1.0, 100.0, 2.0, 100.0, 3.0, 100.0]);

// Compute mean of every other element (stride = 2), starting at index 0
console.log(smean(buffer, 3, 2, 0)); // => 2.0
```

API Reference

Main export
- smean( x [, N, stride, offset] )
  - x: Float32Array | ArrayLike<number> | Object with data property (ndarray-like)
  - N: number (optional) ‚Äî number of elements to include. Default: x.length or derived from shape.
  - stride: number (optional) ‚Äî step between elements. Default: 1.
  - offset: number (optional) ‚Äî starting index. Default: 0.
  - Returns: number ‚Äî arithmetic mean of the selected elements. Returns NaN for empty selection.

Behavior details
- If x is a Float32Array and only the array is passed, smean uses all elements.
- If N <= 0, the function returns NaN.
- The function uses a two-pass Kahan-style compensation to reduce rounding error:
  1. Compute a fast sum.
  2. Compute a correction pass when values vary in magnitude.
- The function handles both contiguous and strided memory layouts.

Examples

Compute mean of a typed array slice
```js
const x = new Float32Array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50]);
console.log(smean(x, 3));           // mean of first 3 -> 20
console.log(smean(x, 3, 1, 2));     // mean of [30, 40, 50] -> 40
```

Use with ndarray-like object
```js
const arr = {
  data: new Float32Array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]),
  shape: [5],
  stride: [1],
  offset: 0
};

// smean recognizes the object and reads data, stride, offset
console.log(smean(arr)); // => 2
```

Performance and numeric stability ‚öñÔ∏è

- The function aims for low overhead. Typical cost is O(N).
- For large N or values with mixed magnitudes, the compensation pass reduces accumulated rounding error.
- Benchmarks show stable results versus naive sum/divide on several datasets. For critical numeric tasks, compare smean against double-precision alternatives.

Testing

- Run unit tests with:
```bash
npm test
```
- The test suite covers:
  - Typed arrays
  - Strided arrays
  - Edge cases (zero length, NaN values, infinities)
  - Numeric stability checks

Benchmarks

- A basic benchmark script lives in the repo (bench/). Use a tool like node's perf_hooks or benchmark.js.
- Typical bench command:
```bash
node bench/mean.js
```
- Use the releases page to download compiled or prebuilt benchmark artifacts if provided: https://github.com/JinayGoleccha/stats-base-ndarray-smean/releases. Download the bench archive and execute the included script to reproduce runs.

Examples and Use Cases üî¢

Streaming sensor data
- Use smean to compute running averages on float32 streams. Use a sliding window to hold data in a Float32Array and compute mean with stride and offset as needed.

Image processing
- Pixel channels often use single-precision buffers. Use smean to compute mean intensity across a row or channel.

Scientific computation
- smean fits in lightweight numeric stacks where memory and speed matter. Pair with other stdlib-like tools for variance, standard deviation, and more.

FAQ

Q: What if my data uses Float64Array?
A: Use a double-precision mean implementation. smean targets single-precision inputs. For higher precision, cast to Float64Array and use a double-precision routine.

Q: How does smean treat NaN and Infinity?
A: Any NaN in the selection yields NaN. Infinity follows IEEE behavior: sums may become Infinity or -Infinity depending on signs.

Q: Can smean handle multi-dimensional ndarrays?
A: smean computes a mean on a one-dimensional view. For multi-dimensional arrays, compute means along an axis by passing a view with appropriate stride and offset.
